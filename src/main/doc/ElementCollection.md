# ElementCollection

An ElementCollection can be used to define a one-to-many relationship to an Embeddable object, 
or a Basic value (such as a collection of Strings). An ElementCollection can also be used in 
combination with a Map to define relationships where the key can be any type of object, and 
the value is an Embeddable object or a Basic value.
